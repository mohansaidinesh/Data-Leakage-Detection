# Data-Leakage-Detection

### ABSTRACT

The study proposes a complex system that uses machine-learning algorithms, rule-based processes, and advanced security protocols to detect data leakage. This system addresses the growing need for robust data protection procedures, as traditional methods often rely on manual monitoring. The system uses computerized detection algorithms to monitor data access patterns in real-time, enabling proactive detection of leakage issues. The system's rule-based procedures improve detection capabilities, allowing for accurate analysis of data usage. Its user-friendly web interface simplifies managing, tracking, and reporting data leakage issues. The system also includes sophisticated security features for data accuracy and regulatory compliance.
